**Who Am I?**

My friends call me coach, due to my desire to help and my ability to communicate ideas effectively...or my penchant for 80's sportswear. I love learning and understanding; from games, reading and a dedication to self-knowledge to blowing whistles, laying out cones and organizing people into groups (maybe I'm taking this coach thing a bit far.)

At heart I'm on a quest to understand myself and everything else. I try and live out of my comfort zone and seek out the difficult in order to improve. Working in Tech is an continuation of what I've striven to do in my life; break a problem down it, learn more and work towards a solution.

## Where to look on Github

**Not My Cat**

A social media app for cat lovers, allowing users to create cat profiles with location. Using Google Maps APIs, geolocation and gamified logic.

I was responsible for implementing the Google Maps API and geolocation features, developing the database and backend routing skills and leadership, positive attitude and modelling.

**Chitter**

A twitter clone allowing users to create a profile and post their thoughts to the world.

I created full stack functionality in database storage, front-end authentication and user creation. I produced DRY, test-driven code following OOP principles

**Engineering** - I have an outcome focussed approach to problems, ensuring I can take a measured approach to finding solutions. This has allowed me to identify areas of gain and quickly develop solutions to improve performance and decrease inefficiencies.

**Customer-Centric** - I am very adept at understanding a customer or client‚Äôs needs and communicating reactively to build a rapport and common goal.

## Personality Traits

#### Resolute

I've pushed my self to improve through self-knowledge. As a result I have sought out experiences such as Native American healing ceremonies and 10 day silent meditation retreats, confronting fear and discomfort in path to learning. 

This has led to improvements in my ability to analyse and improve my weaknesses. An increase in self-belief, happiness and creativity. As well as an ability to see the positives in a situation and instead of giving into frustration, and working out small steps to make a difference in a problem.

- How that looks at work.

At Winter Wonderland 2019, we had a site in the busy street food area. I was responsible for recruiting and training as well as integrating new processes on site. I managed a 15 person team, working 60 hour weeks both managing and helping the team.

We were 50% busier than anticipated. We improved year on year sales by 55% due to improved processes and commercial visibility on-site. I increased year on year profit for the site by 830%. We were light on the ground with managers but I found a way to manage all processes and I focussed on what I could positively affect leading to an amazing outcome.

My reflections after the event led to me completely overhaulng the recruitment, training and on-boarding processes and traning others in the new processes.

#### Social Sensitivity

I am campaigner personality type, wanting to move but wanting others to join me. Through working in sales, customer-service and reading and travelling I have developed an ability to listen and question effectively and empathise with others. I am also a strong communicator so I am able to communicate ideas effectively back to people. 

This means that I am able to lead customers and colleagues forward as a team, it also means when I have to communicate a difficult idea I am able to do so in a way that people will take on board constructively and want to action.

- How this looks at work

This has benefitted me when working in sales. I have been able to build rapport with clients, question and listen to their needs and use my in-depth knowledge to influence them to make positive decisions.

In addtion when leading teams and having to communicate ideas, and criticism. I have a confident and positive approach ensuring I look to empower others.

## Hobbies

I collect vinyls and music in general. I am self-taught in producing music, broadcasting radio shows and I'm learning the piano.
I'm a pretty decent home cook, I think my Italian could challenge your average Nonna and my Chinese and Indian food would stand up to most takeaways.
