#### Resolution/Tenacity

- I've pushes myself to understand and accept some fundamental aspects of the human experience. I have sought out learning experiences, define by my view that the most difficult experiences can lead to the biggest learns. This has led to shamanic vision quests and 10 day silent meditation retreats, confronting fear and discomfort in path to learning. My view is that these are the foundations on which a house is built and my house is built on foundations which have been dug up and relaid to provide ever increasing stability.
- Achievements? Improvements in my ability to analyse and improve my weaknesses. A self-belief combined with an acceptance of uncontrollable factors. The ability to view things both subjectively and objectively. An ever improving resolution to see the positives in a situation
- Evidence - This is evidenced by my joy of life. I bring a positivity and love of life to my world.
  My resolution is evidenced by my performance at WW 2019. I was responsible for recruiting and training as well as integrating new processes on site, increasing the work load for me. I managed to  15 person team, had to put in 60 hour weeks doing a GM role as well as a Team member role. We were 50% busier than anticipated. We improved year on year sales by 55% due to improved processes and commercial visibility on-site. I increased year on year profit for the site by 830%. It was my first experience as GM and my inexperience led me to not hire enough supervisors, ultimately this mean there was a great deal more pressure on me to manage all processes but I focussed on what i could positively affect and this led to an amazing outcome.
  I achieved substantial growth in taking, profit and quality. Identified areas of improvement in training and onboarding and redeveloped the entire training and onboarding process
  I contributed to the growth of the business by training up future managers, developing new site standards and improving profit margins resulting in 830% increase in profit at one site.

#### Creative Reasoning

I am campaigner personality type, like 7% of the population. one of thee strongest attributes I have is strong intuitive creative reasoning. I have an ability to analyse and come up with creative solutions to problems, then in turn I can communicate these ideas to people effectively so they support and action them.

This attribute has manifested itself in many ways over the years. From leading teams, using creative motivational methods such as staff empowerment, road-mapping their development and mood-lightening daily briefs and employee recognition.
As well as being tastemaker in terms of music and fashion.
Currently I am the founder of a  radio project bringing the spontaneity and diverse music of festivals to an internet radio station. This has brought together the problem solving aspects of brand identity, programming and customer recognition as well as the creative aspects of creating shows, coming up with new show ideas and redesigning the radio website.

The ability to use creative reasoning and communicate ideas effectively means coming up with creative solutions to problems and to be able to work as part of a team putting those ideas in to action.
