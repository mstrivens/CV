**Who Am I?**

My friends call me coach, due to the patient and knowing approach I take to helping people out...or my penchant for 80's sportswear. Probably the second come to think of it. Although there might be something in that first one; I love learning and understanding thing; from physical activities, sport, games, musical instruments to blowing whistles, laying out cones and organizing people into groups (maybe I'm taking this coach thing a bit far.)

At heart I'm quest maker. I try and live out of my comfort zone and seek out the difficult in order to improve. Working in Tech is an continuation of what I've striven to do in my life, understand the reality of a situation, break it down it to something simpler and work towards a solution.

A full stack web app using MERN. This is a feature fulled responsive single paged app for cat lovers.

## Skills

Highly adaptable, creative analytical thinker  
Can communicate ideas effectively  
Can recreate and innovate

#### Resolution

I've pushed myself to understand and accept some fundamental aspects of the human experience. I have sought out learning experiences, defined by my view that the most difficult experiences can lead to the biggest learns. This has led to shamanic vision quests and 10 day silent meditation retreats, confronting fear and discomfort in path to learning. I believe that these are the foundations on which a happy life is built and i've set out to make my foundations as strong as possible.

This has led to improvements in my ability to analyse and improve my weaknesses. A self-belief combined with an acceptance of uncontrollable factors. The ability to view things rationally and empathetically. An ability to see the positives in a situation and instead of giving into frustration working out small steps to make a difference in a problem.

- How that looks at work.

At Winter Wonderland 2019, we had a site in the busy street food area. I was responsible for recruiting and training as well as integrating new processes on site. I managed a 15 person team, had to put in 60 hour weeks leading from the front, as well as filling in with the team (sort of like a player/manager.)

We were 50% busier than anticipated. We improved year on year sales by 55% due to improved processes and commercial visibility on-site. I increased year on year profit for the site by 830% (eight hundred and thirty.) It was my first experience as General Manager and whilst inexperience led me to not hire enough managers, I found a way to manage all processes and I focussed on what I could positively affect leading to an amazing outcome.

I achieved substantial growth in taking, profit and quality. Identified areas of improvement in training and onboarding and redeveloped the entire training and onboarding process

I contributed to the growth of the business by training up future managers, developing new site standards and improving profit margins resulting in 830% increase in profit at one site.

#### Creative Reasoning

I am campaigner personality type, wanting to move forward as a team. One of the greatest attributes I have is strong intuitive creative reasoning. I have an ability to analyse and come up with creative solutions to problems, then in turn I can communicate these ideas to people effectively so they support and action them.

The ability to use creative reasoning and communicate ideas effectively means coming up with creative solutions to problems and to be able to work as part of a team putting those ideas in to action.

- How this looks at work

This attribute has manifested itself in many ways over the years. From leading teams, using creative motivational methods such as staff empowerment, road-mapping their development and mood-lightening daily briefs and employee recognition.
I have been involved involved with putting on stages at music events, coming up with ideas for music, crowd participation and hows.
Currently I am a founder of a radio project bringing the spontaneity and diversity of festivals to an internet radio station. This has brought together the problem solving aspects of brand identity, programming and customer recognition as well as the creative aspects of creating shows, coming up with new show ideas and redesigning the radio website.
